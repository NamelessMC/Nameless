## Plugin
For Minecraft integration, you can install the Nameless Plugin in your Spigot server. Currently the plugin is only available for spigot, but we're working on bringing it to different server software, such as Sponge and BungeeCord. You can find a list of features and installation instructions in the [plugin readme](https://docs.namelessmc.com/plugin/2.0/about.md).

## Contributing
We welcome all contributions of code and translations. Please feel free to fork the repository on GitHub and create any pull requests.
- We generally keep a todo list in the Milestones tab of the the Issues page.
- We use Composer to manage dependencies. Before you can install the dependencies, you need to install Composer on your local computer. Installation instructions are [here](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).
- To install the Composer packages we depend on, run the following command in the root directory of the NamelessMC repository:
    ```
    composer install --dev
    ```
  - This could take up to about a minute depending on your internet connection.
