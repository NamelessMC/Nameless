NamelessMC version 2.0.0 is still a pre-release, and is not yet recommended for production use. Keep up to date with development in our [Spigot thread](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/nameless-minecraft-website-software.34810) and our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nameless).

The official project website, providing support and additional downloads such as modules and templates, can be found at [https://namelessmc.com/](https://namelessmc.com/).
